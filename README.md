E-Commerce sales dashboard Project:

Dataset : This E-Commerce sales dashboard presents a comprehensive view of Year-to-Date (YTD) performance across various metrics, including sales, profit, quantity sold, and profit margin. The data-set encompasses sales data segmented by product categories, regions, states, shipping types, and individual product performance.

Objectives : The primary objective is to monitor overall performance trends, identify high and low-performing products and regions, and uncover opportunities for improving sales and profitability. 

Key Visuals : Key visuals include KPI Banner showing YTD Sales, YTD Profit, YTD Quantity sold, YTD Profit Margin. Year on Year growth for each KPI and show a YTD sparkline for each measure in the KPI to understand the monthly trend for each fact. YTD Sales, PYTD Sales, YoY Sales growth for different customer category. Added a trend icon for each category.  Geographic sales map for YTD Sales performance by each State, bar charts for Top 5 and Bottom 5 Products by Sales, donut charts for Region & Shipping Type.

Insights: The dashboard reveals that while total YTD sales slightly declined by 0.83% to $11.53M, profit increased by 4.50% to $1.34M, and profit margin improved by 5.37%. Office Supplies leads in sales but shows a downward trend, while Furniture is the only category with positive YoY growth. The East and West regions contribute the most to revenue, and Standard shipping accounts for 65% of deliveries. Notably, staple-related products dominate the top-selling list.
Despite a slight decline in total sales, profit and profit margin improved, indicating better efficiency or pricing strategy. Focus growth strategies on nonperforming regions (especially South) and lagging product categories (especially Technology). Consider revisiting the bottom-selling products for discontinuation or remarketing.
